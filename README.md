# Project 9 - REST API
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 9 - REST API

In this project, I have created a REST API using Express. I use REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence. 
The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating, and deleting courses in the database. This project also requires users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

To get up and running with this project, download the project files, and run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install
```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

``` 
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
Feel free to use the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file (a collection of Postman requests) to test and explore the REST API.
